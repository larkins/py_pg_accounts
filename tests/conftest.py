"""Shared pytest fixtures for the py_pg_accounts test suite.

Why this exists (2026-09-29):

The test suite runs against the **live production Postgres** (there is
no separate test database yet). Any test that mutates a real row —
especially the singleton `evie@peristyle.ai` business user — can
silently overwrite production state if it does not restore the original
values.

History: `tests/test_address_refactor.py::test_business_address_update_normalises_state`
had a "cleanup" step that hardcoded the user row back to placeholder
values (`1 Example St / Brisbane / QLD 4000`) after every test run.
That cleanup silently corrupted the production address every time the
test suite ran. The user only noticed because the top-right header on
the Statement of Account PDF rendered a placeholder instead of the real
business address.

The `snapshot_row` and `restore_user` fixtures below make the
snapshot/restore pattern trivial to apply correctly:

    def test_some_user_mutation(self, app, restore_user):
        # restore_user snapshots evie@peristyle.ai on entry and
        # restores on exit, even if assertions fail.
        ...

If a test needs to snapshot a different row, use `snapshot_row` directly:

    def test_some_other(self, app, snapshot_row):
        from app.models.customer import Customer
        with app.app_context():
            cid = Customer.query.first().id
            snapshot_row(Customer, cid)
        # ...mutate...
        # teardown is automatic — even if the test raises.

Both fixtures raise loud-and-clear if `app.app_context()` is not active
on entry, since that usually means the test forgot the `app` fixture.

def snapshot_row(app):
    """Factory fixture: snapshot any SQLAlchemy row by (model, pk) and
    restore it on teardown — even if the test raises.

    Usage:

        def test_xyz(self, app, snapshot_row):
            from app.models.customer import Customer
            with app.app_context():
                cid = Customer.query.first().id
                snapshot_row(Customer, cid)
            # ...mutate via the API or directly...

    Snapshots are stacked: you can call `snapshot_row(...)` multiple
    times and they all get restored in reverse order.

    If the row is gone at teardown (e.g. test deleted it), the fixture
    silently skips the restore — that is the intended behaviour for
    tests that intentionally delete rows.
